### Ohey :wave: I'm Tim

I'm one of those "jack of all trades" types. Most of my stuff is in python 3, with many projects having some sort of infosec or devops purpose.
A lot of it is volunteer work and work under NDA, but i aim to make as much of it open source.

Currently i'm a computer science AP student, after switching from a "regular" BSc programme.

A lot of my time goes with audio engineering and "wrestling" valves srcds and sourcemod.
