### Ohey :wave: I'm Tim

I'm one of those "jack of all trades" types. Most of what i do is in Python, with many projects having some sort of infosec or devops related purpose.
Currently the vast majority of the repositories in this account are marked private, for a very annoying reason.

I've recently become a BASc in Computer Science, and i'm now looking for some challenges as a Python/Backend kind of junior dev. So if you know something or someone shoot me an email at jegertim@gmail.com.

Most of my time goes with volunteer work, small POC Python projects or tools and audio engineering.

If you're tragically nostalgic like me, this might tell you more about me:
