### Ohey :wave: I'm Tim

I'm one of those "jack of all trades" types. Most of my stuff is in python 3, with many projects having some sort of infosec or devops purpose.

Currently i'm a computer science AP student, after switching from a "regular" BSc programme.

A lot of my time goes with audio engineering and trying to get better at project management.

If you're tragically nostalgic like me, this might tell you more about me:
