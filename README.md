### Ohey :wave: I'm Tim

I'm one of those "jack of all trades" types. DevOps engineer by day, audio nerd in the weekends.
Most of what i do is in Python, with many projects having some sort of infosec or devops related purpose.
Currently the vast majority of the repositories in this account are marked private, for a very annoying reason.

Most of my free time goes with volunteer work, small POC Python projects or tools and audio engineering/design.

If you're tragically nostalgic like me, this might tell you more about me:
